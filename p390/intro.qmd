# Introduction

This is a book being created for PSYCH390 at the [the University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca).

It is very much a work in progress. You can help it get better by providing feedback. Ideally you will do this by raising an issue on the [github repo](https://github.com/brittAnderson/uwlooP390). Even better is if you would fix the book yourself and make a pull request.
