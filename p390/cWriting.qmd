## Writing Scientific Documents

Writing scientific documents is more than writing papers. It can also include posters, websites, books, and all of these may require images, graphs, references, formuals, and even code. We will take a look here at some of the tools that can help with this, and later we will look in more detail at some of the options. 

## IDEs and Writing up your Research

What does IDE stand for and what are examples of IDEs?

### VSCode

There are many powerful IDEs available. It will be useful for you to try more than one. However, at this moment in time the clear winner of the [IDE popularity](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-new-collab-tools) contest is Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.

Since I want you to learn to use your computer as a tool, and to continue to be able to do so when tooling changes, you need to be able to:

1.  Locate code/programs on the internet
2.  Download and install that program to your computer
3.  Locate the help to begin to use the tool without formal instruction.

Locate, download, install, and verify you can start VS Code.

Additional material about VS Code and its use as an IDE will be found in this [section](cCode.qmd#vscode)

### Overleaf

VS Code is far from your only option. For technical writing and collaboration many scientists rely on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). 

Nature will [let you submit your manuscript](https://www.nature.com/srep/author-instructions/submission-guidelines\) from an Overleaf template.

You always have choices. You can  even [write LaTeX with Quarto](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop?tab=readme-ov-file\) ([see also](https://mark-wang.com/blog/2022/latex/)).

### RStudio

[RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) is a popular IDE for writing R code. R is a programming language particularly useful for statistical analyses. While initially RStudio was only for the R language the number of programming languages it currently supports has grown. It still is not as widely useful as VS Code, and many of RStudio's features are designed for the interactive evaluation of data, and so it has less of the cutting edge features that software developers expect in their code tools. Whether you want to use RStudio or not will depend in part on your planned activity. 

## Scientific Publishing Tools

To understand the plethora of contemporary tooling available to facilitate writing you should know generally what is meant by a mark-up language. This will help you evaluate whether it makes sense for you to switch from a word processiing program, like Word for Windows, to a more general tool like VS Code or [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

Some of the available options you should be familar with are

- LaTeX
  - [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
   This was the standard for several decades, and used more by mathematicians than others, but today it seems limited in that it produces mostly pdfs, and many people also want their files to export to html (webpages)
- [A guide to LaTex for Word Users (pdf)](https://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/info/latex4wp/latex4wp.pdf)
- The descendants of [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- Quarto/Qmd
  -   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (we will skip Rmd and since we are using its successor qmd. Both are related to the people who wrote RStudio,`knitr`, and are now known as [Posit](https://posit.co/)).
- Org Mode
  - [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) works particularly well with Emacs and allows you to embed code from multiple languages. 

## Things You Can Do With Quarto

Here are some of the helper links for things we can do with Quarto:

- [journal formats](https://quarto.org/docs/journals/) try the Elsevier format for this course. A lot of psych journals are Elsevier owned.
- [presentation](https://jjallaire.quarto.pub/reproducible-manuscripts-with-quarto/#/title-slide)
- [Talking to databases](https://danielroelfs.com/blog/sql-notebooks-with-quarto/).
- [Make a website/blog for your work or lab](https://beamilz.com/posts/2022-06-05-creating-a-blog-with-quarto/en/)

### Making a Website with Quarto and Github Pages 

To be included

### Journal Article Authoring

::: {.callout-tip title="Classroom Exercise and HW"}

Write an article with quarto/qmd and using any of the linked article formats. Each has instructions on their use. Your article should look similar to your overleaf submission. All the components of an article, at least one figure, and at least one reference. Instead of using an image from the web try to include either your R or Python code for the figure you liked.

:::

I find this easier to do from a terminal. 

```{sh}
#| eval: false

quarto use template quarto-journals/elsevier
```

This will result in several questions for you to answer. When you are done you have starter versions of all the pieces you will need to get going.
