# The role of the computer as a tool in psychological research

To begin learning how to use the computer as a tool for our research we have to first be clear on what that means. Before we go into specific tools let's discuss the research process so we can better detect where there are opportunities for us to use computers and software to aid our work.

Ignore for the moment the specific content of a psychological research project. That is whether it is a study on attention or memory. Let's consider abstractly what are the components of a psychological research project? And then how can computers help us to do our research better? For right now we will focus on the stages of research and the tools we are now using, if any, and then we will return to the particular research stages for developing our experience with particular research tools.

## Research Project Stages

### Preliminaries

How do you decide what it is you are going to do? Look up and read the prior literature.

1.  How do you find what to read?
2.  How do you keep track of what you have read?
3.  How do you organize your notes on what you have read?
4.  How do you integrate and connect your notes and readings so as to discover new connections or ideas?
5.  How to you make sure you can correctly cite the articles you have read when it comes to writing up your research proposal or research result.

How do you protect yourself against a change in databases or death of a harddrive?

### Do the research

What skills are needed for this?

1.  Program an experiment
2.  Language? Python; Javascript; other
    1.  How do you make stuff appear on a computer screen?
    2.  How do you verify the timing?
3.  How do you make sure you can find the version of the experiment if you need to share it or re-use it.
4.  There is a new tool in the lab with drivers and hardware. Can you download and install the necessary software?
5.  What happens to the data?
    1.  How do you store it?
    2.  How do you search it?
    3.  What if it is big?
    4.  What if it needs to be shared?

### Analyzing the Research

1.  How do you organize the data?
2.  Working on a big data project?
    1.  How do you get the data?
    2.  Can you set up a database?
    3.  Search it?
3.  How do you do statistics?
    1.  What is the tool?
    2.  Could you write your own analysis?

### Diseminate the Research

1.  What is the tool you use for writing your research?
2.  What is reproducibility?
3.  Does your writing tool support it?
4.  How do you make sure others can re-run your analyses?
5.  How do you make sure that you can easily adapt your analyses and make sure the right figures are included when you update the data? Or that the p-values in the text are also adapted?
6.  How do you change the citation format when you submit to a journal that does not want APA or an edit changes which of your citations is the first (so it changes when you use et al)?

### Make Your Research Open

-   Should research be open?
-   How many of your labs are following these practices?
