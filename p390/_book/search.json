    "text": "2.1.1 Preliminaries\nHow do you decide what it is you are going to do? Look up and read the prior literature.\n\nHow do you find what to read?\nHow do you keep track of what you have read?\nHow do you organize your notes on what you have read?\nHow do you integrate and connect your notes and readings so as to discover new connections or ideas?\nHow to you make sure you can correctly cite the articles you have read when it comes to writing up your research proposal or research result.\n\nHow do you protect yourself against a change in databases or death of a harddrive?\n\n\n2.1.2 Do the research\nWhat skills are needed for this?\n\nProgram an experiment\nLanguage? Python; Javascript; other\n\nHow do you make stuff appear on a computer screen?\nHow do you verify the timing?\n\nHow do you make sure you can find the version of the experiment if you need to share it or re-use it.\nThere is a new tool in the lab with drivers and hardware. Can you download and install the necessary software?\nWhat happens to the data?\n\nHow do you store it?\nHow do you search it?\nWhat if it is big?\nWhat if it needs to be shared?\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Analyzing the Research\n\nHow do you organize the data?\nWorking on a big data project?\n\nHow do you get the data?\nCan you set up a database?\nSearch it?\n\nHow do you do statistics?\n\nWhat is the tool?\nCould you write your own analysis?\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Diseminate the Research\n\nWhat is the tool you use for writing your research?\nWhat is reproducibility?\nDoes your writing tool support it?\nHow do you make sure others can re-run your analyses?\nHow do you make sure that you can easily adapt your analyses and make sure the right figures are included when you update the data? Or that the p-values in the text are also adapted?\nHow do you change the citation format when you submit to a journal that does not want APA or an edit changes which of your citations is the first (so it changes when you use et al)?\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Make Your Research Open\n\nWhat is “open research”?\nShould research be open?\nHow many of your labs are following these practices?\n\nWhat are Open Science practices?\n\n10 strategies for open science\nJupyter notebooks in Psychology\n10 rules for lab notebooks (electronic)\nHow to keep a lab notebook\nPick an electronic lab notebook\nLab notebook 2023 guide\n\nWhat are the Fair principles for research\n\nFair principles\nFair guiding principles\nA class activity to figure out what Fair stands for and then discuss the specific terms and see if we agree. We can then use those principles to evaluate our research tools.\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Coding\nFor a lot of the above we need to know how to code. In order to write code we need minimally to answer two questions. What language? What tooling?\n\n2.1.6.1 Languages\nWhat should I consider when selecting a programming language? Will it do what I need it to do now and tomorrow.\n\nIs SPSS a good language for statistics?\nIs R a good language for statistics?\nIs Python a good language for statistics?\nIs R a good language for coding a web app?\nIs R a good language for coding an in-lab visual experiment?\nShould you use Julia? Common Lisp? Haskell? Lean? OCaml? Rust? Go?\n\nHow do you future proof? - If languages go in and out of fashion what is it you should really be learning about programming? What are good coding practices?\n\n\n\n2.1.7 IDEs\n\nWho are you writing code for? Human or Machine?\nWhat is an IDE? What makes for a good IDE?\n\n\n2.1.7.1 Using an IDE\nFor this course we will default to VSCode, because it is currently very popular and becoming somewhat of a standard. Everything said above about not getting to attached to the flavor of the month applies to IDEs. Especially since VSCode is a tool tied to Microsoft. However, there is an opensource build of VSCode that you can use instead. You can also use anyother tool you want as long as you can figure out how to make it do the things I will ask you to do. I, for one, live in Emacs.\n\n\n2.1.7.2 VSCode\n\n\nBasics video\nUsing VSCode with R\nUsing VSCode with Python\n\nExercise Install VSCode\n\n\n2.1.7.3 Jupyter Notebooks\nWhat are jupyter notebooks? Are jupyter notebooks ide’s? What are their purpose? What languages to they support?\n\n\n2.1.7.4 Quarto\nWhat is RStudio? What happened to RStudio? How does Quarto relate to RStudio? What languages does it support? Can you write code in it? Can you write text in it? Can you write an article in it?\n\n\n\n2.1.8 In Lab Experiments\n\nMaking stuff appear on monitors.\nWhat is OpenGL?\nUse pygame to make some simple visual experiments.\nHave a beauty contest the following week to see what people have been able to make?\nMake sure that people are using venv\n\n\n\n2.1.9 Online Experiments\nRunning a server for testing and more? XAMPP Running a lab now seems to require some familiarity with servers. And people who want to write their experiments in javascript often want to try things out first so it seems something like XAMPP might be a good resource. Exercise to download and get the XAMPP server running? Need to expand this. An exercise with JavaScript? This site has a simple bit of code for throwing an image on the screen. Then use the XAMPP server to test it? Require changing the image? Animate a button to toggle or get a random image?\n\n\n2.1.10 Databases and management\n\nWhat is it\nA book on DuckDB - database stuff\nMariaDB This SQL like, and open source. Might be easier to get started with and still be SQL enough to give them some professional benefits. I was thinking we could get some data online, often they come as CSV’s and read it into the database? This is one example how. A blog that compares MariaDB to SQL. A quickie tutorial.\nWhy would I want to use a relational database over a csv file (or R data frame or similar)? This could be a class exercise and discussion.\nExercise Download MariaDB\n\n\n\n2.1.11 Sharing The Results\n\n\n2.1.12 Reproducible Report Authoring\n\n\n2.1.13 Scientific Publishing\n\nQuarto (the former RStudio people)\n\njournal formats try the Elsevier format for this course. A lot of psych journals are Elsevier owned.\n\na presentation\nSomeone showing how to connect an sql database to quarto.\nA curated list of Quarto related stuff\nSingle authored system thoughts Maybe a blog to be read and discussed?\nMake a website/blog for your work or lab?\n\nQuarto provides an option. For example: here\n\nWhy not just write in LaTeX? For that matter what is LaTeX?\n\n\n\n2.1.14 Miscellaneous Readings and Topics\n\n\n2.1.15 Datascience\n\none person’s roadmap for non-cs grads\n\n\n\n2.1.16 Grant Funding\nAt the moment I am not sure if will have time for this. But thinking of having the students review the peer review manual for NSERC Discovery Grants. Then have them each write a minimal proposal. Assign the proposals to members of the class, and then hold our own reviewers meeting to decide which projects to fund. Top grants get performed for experiments? Get extra-credit points?",
