    "text": "Preface\nThis is a Quarto book. Quarto can be seen as a successor to RStudio and Rmd files. If you have not heard of those do not worry. If you have you will see that most things are quite similar.\nI will be using Quarto in this class (PSYCH390 W2025) to help us practice writing reproducible code and papers. There are many different systems that can accomplish the same goal and we will look at a few of them so that you are not anchored to any one system. But in order to have one shared experience and to move beyond the basics, at least a bit, we will use this tool.\nOne of the key lessons for learning to use your computer effectively as a research tool is learning how to do things generally; rather than mastering one particular variety of software we want to be able to figure out how to use whatever is the right tool for a particular application. Our needs may change as our science evolves, and the tools available to us will definitely change. You don’t want to be stuck 20 years from now using the software you learned in University. If you are, your science will suffer, and you will be less able to tackle the problems that interest you. Instead of doing the key experiment, you will be figuring out how to do the experiment that is most like, but not quite, the right one, but is as well as you can do with the old software you know how to use.\nTo learn more about Quarto books from the Quarto people visit https://quarto.org/docs/books.\nTo learn more about the specifics of how we are going to use Quarto, and what else we will experiment with along the way, stay tuned.",

Some components of these videos may be a bit out of date, and a few things about the interface have changed. Still they may be a reasonable starting point for those of you who feel you need a refresher on version control. Note that for PSYCH390 I am assuming you can either already use version control or figure it out on your own. I will give some class time for getting things working, but mostly you will have to pursue this on your own. The notes here are intended to be prompts and guides, but not to be comprehensive.\nYou will notice that in the videos I talk a lot about Linux. We are not using that for this course so you can ignore those references. However, I do demonstrate the use in the terminal. That is available to all of you regardless of operating system. You will just have to find your own OS version of it.\nFrequenly you will see this referred to as a command line tool (“cli”).

    "text": "A.8 Principal Terms to Learn First\n\nFork: A copy of one github repository to another github repository.\nClone: A copy of one git repository to another git repository. The first repository might be hosted on github, but the second one, the cloned one exists on a local machine. In your case this is probably your laptop.\nRemote: This is a repository that you are following. You will typically pull from these, but your push permissions may be limited depending on the distinctions between forks and clones, and whether you own the remote or someone else does. You can have more than one remote.\nPull: the transfer of information and changes from one repository incorporated into another. This is how you get the new information from a remote transported to a local repository that you control.\nPush: this is the transfer of information to a repository you control (or have permissions to push to) from another repository that you control. This is often from your local laptop version to the hosted repository (your fork) on github.\nPull Request: When you have information or changes that you think would be helpful to a remote you do not have push permissions for then you can request that the owner of that repository pull in your changes. This is a formal process called a pull request. It is primarily a github concept and not a git concept.\nBranch: within a repository the development of the code may be proceeding in a few different directions at the same time. The principal production branch is conventionally called master. And the principal repository that is the main, shared one is called origin. We will not be working with branches in our course, but those terms do show up in commands.\n\nAll of these “basics” are covered in detail in the book Pro Git (available on line).",
