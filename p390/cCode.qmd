### Coding

For a lot of the above we need to know how to code. In order to write code we need minimally to answer two questions. What language? What tooling?

#### Languages

What should I consider when selecting a programming language? Will it do what I need it to do now and tomorrow.

-   Is SPSS a good language for statistics?
-   Is R a good language for statistics?
-   Is Python a good language for statistics?
-   Is R a good language for coding a web app?
-   Is R a good language for coding an in-lab visual experiment?
-   Should you use Julia? Common Lisp? Haskell? Lean? OCaml? Rust? Go?

Break up class to do some quick research and make a case for each. Goal is to help them see the diversity of what is out there. One of the ideas is the Swiss Army Knife idea. It is a pretty handy to thing to have, but is it the best tool for anything?

How do you *future proof*?
-   If languages go in and out of fashion what is it you should really be learning about programming? What are good coding practices?

Another possible classroom exercise.
-   documentation
-   small functions
-   avoid spaghetti
-   use libraries

### IDEs

-   Who are you writing code for? Human or Machine?
-   What is an IDE? What makes for a good IDE?

#### Using an IDE

For this course we will default to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), because it is currently very popular and becoming somewhat of a standard. Everything said above about not getting to attached to the flavor of the month applies to IDEs. Especially since VSCode is a tool tied to Microsoft. However, there is an [opensource build](https://vscodium.com/) of VSCode that you can use instead. You can also use anyother tool you want as long as you can figure out how to make it do the things I will ask you to do. I, for one, live in [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

*Exercise* Install VSCode

#### Jupyter Notebooks

What are jupyter notebooks? Are jupyter notebooks ide's? What are their purpose? What languages to they support?
