* Just a place for some notes for installing things on Mac

* Emacs
  I used homebrew awhile ago for this and forgot the details.
  
** init files
   Seems to live at ~/home/britt/.emacs.d/init.el~

   Added these lines and restarted to get the basic package set up working.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :eval never
     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
     (package-initialize)
     (require 'use-package)
     (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
   #+end_src
