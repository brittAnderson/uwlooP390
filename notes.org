Something to use in the new course:

How to access and use large datasets?
* Ideas
** Coding
*** Languages
    - why pick one; which one?
      - SASS → R → ?Julia; do you know what language will be /the/ language in a few years time? So, better to learn /about/ languages than focus on mastering any one language.
      - Still, today, the default seems to be python. We will make that our default language, but will probably find ourselves using others that better fit other tasks.
    - How to write code?
      For a human reader. The machine doesn't care, but you will, and so will your collaborators. To make your science useful to others your code should communicate, not just execute.

** Fair principles for research
   - [[https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/][Fair principles]]
   - [[https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618][Fair guiding principles]]
   - A class activity to figure out what Fair stands for and then discuss the specific terms and see if we agree. We can then use those principles to evaluate our research tools. 
** Databases and management
   - [[https://www.dataversity.net/what-is-database-management/][What is it]]
   - [[https://learning-oreilly-com.proxy.lib.uwaterloo.ca/library/view/getting-started-with/9781803241005/B18270_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015][A book on DuckDB - database stuff]]
   - Why would I want to use a relational database over a csv file (or R data frame or similar)?
     This could be a class exercise and discussion.
*** [[https://mariadb.org/][MariaDB]]
     This SQL like, and open source. Might be easier to get started with and still be SQL enough to give them some professional benefits. I was thinking we could get some data online, often they come as CSV's and read it into the database? This is [[https://www.simplified.guide/mysql-mariadb/import-csv][one example]] how.

** Datascience
   - [[https://medium.com/@fareedkhandev/complete-roadmap-of-data-science-for-non-cs-cs-students-equivalent-to-a-degree-1a0a810360c0][one person's roadmap for non-cs grads]]
** Data
   Part of the motivation for the above is the need to work with larger volumes of data than we may use in our current labs. [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01872-8][Here]] a description of some [[https://zenodo.org/records/7249732][online psychology data]] that we could use for our course work. 

   There are some supplied [[https://github.com/pauljaffe/lumos-ncpt-tools/blob/main/demo.ipynb][tools]] for looking at these data that run in notebooks.

   Challenges for reproducibility[fn:1] include the state of date and computational tools. See this [[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05990-5][nature blog]] post. 
** IDEs
*** VSCode

      - What is "pip"?
    - [[https://quarto.org/docs/tools/text-editors.html][Text Editor Page from Quarto Site]]
** Servers and more: [[https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html][XAMPP]]
   Running a lab now seems to require some familiarity with servers. And people who want to write their experiments in javascript often want to try things out first so it seems something like [[https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html][XAMPP]] might be a good resource. 
** Sharing The Results
*** Reproducible Report Authoring
*** Scientific Publishing
    - [[https://coko.foundation/articles/single-source-publishing.html][Single authored system thoughts]]
      Maybe a blog to be read and discussed?
    - [[https://quarto.org/][Quarto]] (the former RStudio people)
      - [[https://quarto.org/docs/journals/][journal formats]]
	try the Elsevier format for this course. A lot of psych journals are Elsevier owned.

* Things that I may need reminding about.
** Python interpreter and venv in VS Code
   There may be a global python on a machine, but there may be other versions installed that are not compatible. If this is the case you need to go into the venv and find the ~.../bin/python..~. You do this through the =command palette= of vs code. Look for python select interpreter and navigate to the one you need. A couple of webpages helped me with this:

[fn:1] What is the difference between "replicability" and "reproducibility"?
