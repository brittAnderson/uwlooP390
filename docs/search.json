    "text": "Preface\nThis course is an effort to expose research minded undergraduate students in psychology to the wealth of computational and programming tools that they can use to ease their research tasks, and in some cases do things that they could not do otherwise. It is in written as a series of qmd files. This makes it a Quarto book. Quarto can be seen as a successor to RStudio and Rmd files. It is in another in the series of markup languages that allow you to write in plain text, but by following certain conventions, make it easy to convert those plain text files into any number of output formats such as html (for a website) or pdf (for a book or article). I want to emphasize the writing of reproducible code and papers. There are many different systems that can accomplish this goal. Quarto is just one option, but it is one of the easier ones to get started with. In addition, to Quarto, we will explore IDEs via Visual Studio Code, and also some of the basics of programming, bibliographic tools, and auxilliary tools like zettlekasten and databases.\nYou do not need to read this book in order. At this early draft stage some things are repeated, some are missing, and some are misordered. You may have to jump around to find what you are looking for.\nOne of the key lessons for learning to use your computer effectively as a research tool is learning how to do things generally; rather than mastering one particular variety of software; we want to be able to figure out how to use whatever is the right tool for a particular application. Your needs will change as your science evolves. The tools available will change. You don’t want to be still using the software you learned in University twenty years from now. If you are you will be less able to tackle the problems that interest you. Instead of doing the key experiment, you will be figuring out how to do the experiment that is most like, but not quite, the right one, but is as well as you can do with the old software you know how to use.",

However, at this moment in time the clear winner of the IDE popularity contest is Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code.\nSince I want you to learn to use your computer as a tool, and to continue to be able to do so when tooling changes, you need to be able to:\n\nLocate code/programs on the internet\nDownload and install that program to your computer\nLocate the help to begin to use the tool without formal instruction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class Exercise\n\n\n\nLocate, download, install, and verify you can start VS Code.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Some helpful links to get you started\n\nBasics Video\nUsing VSCode with Python\nUsing VSCode with R\nText Editor Page from Quarto Site\n\nWhat is “pip”?

For technical writing and collaboration many scientists rely on Overleaf.\nNature will [let you submit your manuscript](https://www.nature.com/srep/author-instructions/submission-guidelines) from an Overleaf template.\nYou always have choices. You can even [write LaTeX with Quarto](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop?tab=readme-ov-file) (see also).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassroom Discussion\n\n\n\nWhat is single source publishing? How does this idea impact your preference for tools like Overleaf and Quarto?\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 RStudio\nRStudio is a popular IDE for writing R code. R is a programming language particularly useful for statistical analyses. While initially RStudio was only for the R language the number of programming languages it currently supports has grown. It still is not as widely useful as VS Code, and many of RStudio’s features are designed for the interactive evaluation of data, and so it has less of the cutting edge features that software developers expect in their code tools. Whether you want to use RStudio or not will depend in part on your planned activity.",

    "text": "5.3 Things You Can Do With Quarto\nHere are some of the helper links for things we can do with Quarto:\n\njournal formats try the Elsevier format for this course. A lot of psych journals are Elsevier owned.\npresentation\nTalking to databases.\nMake a website/blog for your work or lab\nAnd more …\n\n\n5.3.1 Making a Website with Quarto and Github Pages\nAs science progressively moves to online communication there is a need to have a place to show case your work and share ideas. One way to do this is with a personal website structured around your scientific interests and activities. While there are many methods, tools, and hosts for this I will focus on sharing how you can use the Quarto publishing tool.\n\n5.3.1.1 Hosting\nTo have a website viewable by the world it must be hosted on a server that is viewable by the world. For example, it cannot be behind an institutional firewall (as are most of the computers at the University of Waterloo). And if you host on a University or Company server you have the potential of being limited in what you can share, how often you can update, or you may be required to adhere to certain styles and formats mandated by the institution’s brand. One way to avoid this is to find an external hosting site. A modest fee would allow you to have a virtual server in the cloud, but the example we will use here to get you started is a free service available to those with Github accounts: Github Pages.\n\n5.3.1.1.1 Testing Github Pages\nAssuming you have an account you should be able to create a minimal webpage in a few steps.\n\nGo to personal dashboard and create a new repo as instructed on the Github Pages website. The repo must be named .github.io.\nUse terminal to clone this repo to your local computer.\ncd into the correct directory using your terminal (inside VS Code is fine). And using the terminal do `echo “hello world” &gt; index.html.\nDo the usual add, commit, and push and verify your web site works at &lt;username.github.io&gt;.\n\nYou now have a website!\n\n\n\n5.3.1.2 Blog Project in Quarto\nThe advantage of managing your blog (or website) in Quarto is that you get to take advantage of all the markdown language features. This is much more convenient than writing in html directly. You can also embed code and output just as you have been doing when you export your R code to html.\nThere are several ways that the Quarto people recommend getting the material to and from github. The one that I found most convenient (that is the one that I got working with the least amount of swearing) was to configure a project that exports to a docs directory.\nCreating the blog project in Quarto.\n\nIn the terminal move to the directory with your repo.\nCreate a branch called gh-pages.\n\nYou can find the steps for creating this branch at blog, but for the later steps he uses the publish option where we will output to docs.\nMake sure everything is committed or stashed before you begin then:\n\n\ngit checkout --orphan gh-pages\ngit reset --hard\ngit commit --allow-empty -m \"Initializing gh-pages branch\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nIf you are going to try the “publish” option you will not want to edit in the gh-pages branch. That branch will just be used for publishing your content. However, when using the docs approach, as I am illustrating, it is fine to just work on the gh-pages branch directly. For the docs method to work properly you must go into your settings for this repository on Github and find the Pages area. Then make you set the branch correctly and point it to the docs/ directory\n\n\n\nAdd the following to your .gitignore:\n/.quarto/\n/_site/\nIf you don’t have such a file, create it. If you don’t know what a .gitignore file is ask!\nNow we use the quarto command in the terminal to initiate our website as a project. This creates the basic structure we need. We can later change or adapt it.\n\nquarto create project blog .\nWhen I did this it asked me for a title and then it asked to open everything in vs code. Then you will want to edit the _quarto.yml file to direct the output to the docs/ directory. The top of you file should look like\n\nproject:\n  output-dir: docs/\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"brittAnderson.github.io\"\n...\n\nTry quarto preview to see the current skeleton.\nExplore the files to see what you can change. Try the about page for a starter. Can you add a picture of yourself, and make it say your name?\nTry adding a post. First study the structure of the existing posts. You will need to emulate this in order for things to track correctly.\nThen publish quarto render This command will compile the html versions of your qmd code and direct them to the correct places. Then if you have set up thing correctly you can use the git features within VS Code to commit and push your changes. After a few minutes they should be available via your github link.\nMy files are at Britt’s Github Example and the demo is at brittanderson.github.io.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Journal Article Authoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassroom Exercise and HW\n\n\n\nWrite an article with quarto/qmd and using any of the linked article formats. Each has instructions on their use. Your article should look similar to your overleaf submission. All the components of an article, at least one figure, and at least one reference. Instead of using an image from the web try to include either your R or Python code for the figure you liked.\n\n\nI find this easier to do from a terminal.\n#| eval: false\n\nquarto use template quarto-journals/elsevier\nThis will result in several questions for you to answer. When you are done you have starter versions of all the pieces you will need to get going.\n\n\n5.3.3 Presentations\nPresentations are a standard component of professional life. Despite that importance the materials are often developed in a casual way that does not give the best impact to the material. There are many more versatile tools than contemporary Power Point. Though power point can make an effective presentation its default use does not typically achieve that goal. Quarto provides easy access to two other presentation tools that will expand one’s recognition of what an effective presentation tool can do.\n\n5.3.3.1 Reveal.JS\nReveal.js is a javascript library for the creating presentations that work as well on the web as they do in person. Quarto also supports Reveal.js.\n\n\n5.3.3.2 Beamer\nBeamer is a package for LaTeX that allows professional quality typesetting. It is particularly relevant for presentations that have a lot of mathematical material, though it is quite capable of supporting any general presentation as well. It is less flexible for the web since it produces PDFs. These can be shared on the web, but they require the intermediate step of downloading them rather than just playing them. Beamer also has a “Poster” variant that can be used to make high quality academic posters.\nOverleaf has a beginners tutorial. Quarto also supports Beamer.\n\n\n5.3.3.3 Academic Posters\nTypest",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Even before you start coding programs you can use simple coding constructs to efficiently command your computer to do things, script repetitive tasks, or find information hard to locate through a GUI interface. To whet your appetite I have included a short video I made for another course showing some use of the Terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Question\n\n\n\nWhat is a terminal?\n\n\nTo use your terminal you need to do somethings first:\n\nFind your terminal. Different operating systems refer to the terminal differently. In Windows the =CMD.exe= [fn:1] command is an approximation to a terminal as is the Power Shell. For OSX you navigate to you applications, find the folder “Utilities” and look in their for the terminal application. For Linux it will depend on which particular flavor you have installed.\nLearn some terminology While they do not mean exactly the same thing, you will often find the following terms being used relatively interchangeably.\n\nterminal\nshell\ncommand line What they have in common is the idea of a text based interface to communicating with the operating system. What this means is that instead of opening a gui (gui: G raphical U ser I nterface) to navigate your file tree you do this with a text based system of commands.\n\nTry out some sample commands\n\n\n\n\n\nls\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Typing this command in your terminal will list the files and directory. What would you have to do to see the hidden files? How would you get more information about this function and how to use it?\n\n\n\n\n6.0.1 An Historical Aside\nIn the early days of computing people wrote their programs on punch cards. Some see the inspiration as the Jacquard machine. There are still programmers alive who can tell you their horror stories of tripping and falling and scattering their punch cards everywhere. Want to know if your program worked? Take it to the main frame data center, drop it off, and come back the next day to get your print out. Terminals came along as an alternative to communicating with big central processors. There was a screen and keyboard. By typing you could send input to the computer that returned the output to your screen. The terminals we have today are not true terminals, but emulators. Though few people refer to them as such. We emulate this old way of communicating to the processor because it works and is efficient.\n\n\n6.0.2 Why use a terminal?\nYou can get more done. You can get it done more quickly. Once you learn to do one hard thing you never have to figure out how to do it again, because you can easily script it. That is why you want to learn to use the terminal\nTerminals are ubiquitous. They are low in their resource usage. They permit remote logins without the need for sending graphics back and forth. In fact, the remote computer need not have a system installed for displaying windows or even a physical screen attached (called headless).\nKnowing how to use a terminal will allow you to use =ssh= to connect to remote hosts. It will allow you to quickly and efficiently navigate your system, and it will make it easy for you to do things that used to take ages.\n\n\n6.0.3 A scripting example\nWant to convert and compress a large directory of videos as I did for this course. No need to open up each in an application and click a bunch of mouse clicks. Just write a =bash= script to invoke a command line program to do all the work for you. Go get a cup of coffee and come back when the job is done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: How would you pronounce XKCD?\n\n\n\n\n   for i in *.MP4; \n   do name=`echo \"$i\" | cut -d'.' -f1`; \n   echo \"$name\"; \n   ffmpeg -i \"$i\" -c:v libx264 -b:v 1.5M -c:a aac -b:a 128k \"${name}S.mp4\";\n   done\n\nAlmost all of this I copied off the Internet where it appeared as an answer to a question from someone else wanting to do essentially the same thing I did. It took me a while to tweak it to my particular use case, but when that was done my problem was solved, /forever./ Every new batch of videos I just put in their own directory and run this script from the command line. Note that this script uses a for loop, this is a very common programming construct.\n\n\nfor (i in seq(1,5)) { print(i)}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n\n\nThis code block demonstrates a simple for loop for the R programming language.\n\n\n\n6.0.4 Resources on Terminals\nThere are a great many resources on how to use the terminal effectively, but don’t go out and read them all. One of the skills to learn in learning to use the computer is to develop your own set of links and resources you can go to when need arises. Don’t try to learn everything at once. You will get overwhelmed and discouraged. Instead you learn what you need when the need arises. And if you need to know something more than once, then you spend the time to dive deeper. There are a great many things about using the terminal that I do not know, but I know the ones I use often, and I know where to find more when I need to know more. You should do the same. Here are a few online resources to get you started.\n\nThe command line\nA Short Series of Terminal Lessons from the UbuntuWiki\nSome Scripting Basics\nAnother Scripting Introduction\n\nMost of what you want to do at the command line, at least in the beginning, you can do with typing directly into the terminal. But at some point you will want to write a file, a script, that has all the commands typed into it. They you can run that script from the terminal. This blog post has some basic background for how to get started.\nNote the use of the term “BASH”. This stands for the Bourne Again Shell. Your terminal can use different shells (and if you are using a mac you are probably using the zsh shell). So while you can use the terms interchangeably most of the time, they don’t mean exactly the same thing.\n\n\n6.0.5 Terminal Games Again\nThese will only work on linux and OS X. If you are on windows you could enable the linux subsystem for linux or you could learn the powershell equivalents. But I suggest that you use the terminals that are built into VS Code for practice. You will usually see these at the bottom of your screen. If not, there is a menu you can use to open one.\n\nls -la /home/\n\n\nWhat does all this output mean?\nWhat changes when you leave out the -la?\nWhat does the hyphen do?\n\n\nCan you find the location of your desktop folder in your terminal?\nCan you change to that directory? cd\nFind out where you are? pwd\nCan you find out who the computer thinks you are, your user name? whoami\nFind out how much free space you have on your computer disk. df -h\nHow do you get help for most of these commands? Usually command –help or (-h)\nHow do you find the manual? man ls\nNavigating\n\nPaths: absolute and relative.\nWhat do those “dots” mean?\nWhat do those slashes mean?\nTab is your friend.\nTry the up arrow too.\n\nFile ownership\n\nMake a text file from the command line. touch /home/yourname/Documents/testText.txt\nWho owns it?\n\nMake a directory mkdir /home/britt/Documents/myFirstDir/ Spaces are the enemy. Never use them, but if you have to, escape () them.\n\n\n\n6.0.6 Using the Terminal to Setup a Python Venv and install Jupyterlab\nThe terminal can also be a very convenient and direct to install programs. You are not clicking buttons in a gui and hoping things work. You have to know exactly what program you want and where you want to put it. As an example we see how we might use the terminal to establish a python virutal environment and use that venv to implement a jupyterlab setup. You will find more on python virtual environments in the appendix.\nOur goal is to be able to test and develop the idea of a jupyter lab notebook. But we will need several pieces of code installed. Assuming we have python3 installed we can use the terminal to set up a secure enviroment for creating a virtual environment. Think of a sandbox that let’s you play without getting the things you installed for experimentation conflict with your system’s tools.\n\nOpen a terminal\nMake a directory (mkdir)\n“cd” into your new directory and create the virtual environment\n\npython3 -m venv .\n\nNext, “activate” the environment with\n\nsource ./bin/activate\n\nNow you can install the needed packages with pip.\n\npip install numpy matplotlib jupyterlab",

    "text": "8.1 All-in-one options\nOne of the most common uses of computers in psychology is for the programming of experiments. Classic experiments often involve a combination of visual stimuli that the participant has to respond to in someway. Typical responses are often button presses or mouse clicks, though many other varieties of stimuli and reports are used. While many programming languages can be used for this task we will begin with one of the most popular, Python. And if time permits we can explore some examples with Javascript as the world of experimental psychology is increasingly complementing the usual lab based testing paradigm with online studies.\nExcellent tools exist that provide turn-key solutions. A very popular one is Psychopy. This package is available for the popular operating systems and gives a gui like builder that allows you to program visually. It offers the opportunity to output your experiment into a web friendly format that can integrate with an online hosting service for performing experiments. However, my experience is that while such tools make it easy to get started they don’t help people develop the general skills that will transfer into programming that distinctive experiment that no one else has done. And the knowledge you gain is often interface specific. It is not general, and so your learning cannot transfer into writing R code or porting your experiment to MATLAB if that becomes the tool a collaborator wants to use. Even if this is the sort of tool you eventually settle on for the very reasonable reasons that your experimental needs are not complex and the quality of the implementation allows you to get work done more easily and on board new investigators more quickly, it will still make you better at planning and handling problems if you have a knowledge of what is going on under the hood.",

    "text": "8.2 Python\nThe following examples focus on the sort of experiment where you want something to appear on the screen, and you want feedback from the participant. Current computer graphics don’t work like they did twenty years ago when we all had heavy CRTs on our desks, but one can still deploy some of the intuitions of that era.\nThe monitor is a screen and it is displaying a picture. In the background what is to be shown next is in preparation and at some point what is on the display now will be replaced by the next collection in the queue. Even though we no longer literally raster the display from top to bottom and side to side you can still usefully think in terms of frames. Thus, almost all your experiments will need the mechanics of a window the participant views and in which you can write things you want them to see.\n\n8.2.1 Pygame\nFor practice I will use the pygame python library. There are a large number of help and tutorials for this well established library that has been in use for decades. It is well vetted and documented, and relies on a simple direct library for video manipulations.\n\n8.2.1.1 Some Links for Getting Started with Pygame\n\nThe pygame getting started wiki. Most of my examples will draw from this site.\nReal python pygame tutorial\nGame Development Academy\n\n\n\n8.2.1.2 Installation\nA virtual environment is recommended, but not necessary. If you are using a venv activate it first.\nThen\n1pip install pygame\n\n2python -m pygame.examples.aliens\n\n1\n\nThis line installs the library.\n\n2\n\nThis launches a test game. If you see the game, you have installed pygame. I find this game plays a little fast on modern hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\nimport sys,pygame\npygame.init()\n\nmywindow = pygame.display.set_mode([800,800])\nrunning = True\nwhile running:\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n            running = False\n    mywindow.fill((128,15,15))\n    pygame.display.flip()\n        \npygame.quit()\nsys.exit()\n\n\nFigure 8.1: This python program will, assuming you have installed pygame, launch a window and close it when you click the “x”. Can you change the window size and background color?\n\n\n\nOne of the better ways to get started is to gradually hand in functionality one step at a time until you have the basics of what you need on a trial and then to refine that to loop through the multiple trials you will probably need.\nHere is an example of a bit of code that shows some elementary use of the mouse, response time, shape and text functionality.\nfrom itertools import compress\nimport sys,pygame\npygame.init()\n\n\nmy_font = pygame.font.Font(None,72)\ntest_text = my_font.render(\"Hello P390\", 1, (200,10,200))\ntest_text_pos = test_text.get_rect(centerx = 400)\n\n#Helper functions\ndef which_buttons (bs):\n    return(list(compress(range(len(bs)),bs)))\n\n#button colors\nclrs = [(0,0,255),(0,225,0),(225,0,0)]\nactv_clr = 0\nrslts = {'trial_num': -1,'color' : None ,'time' : None}\n\nmywindow = pygame.display.set_mode([800,800])\nrunning = True\nmyrt_clock = pygame.time.Clock()\nt1 = myrt_clock.tick(60)\nanew = pygame.mouse.get_pressed()\ntrl = -1,\nclr = clrs[0]\nwhile running:\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n            running = False\n    mywindow.fill((128,15,15))\n    pygame.draw.circle(mywindow, clrs[actv_clr], (400,400), 75)\n    mywindow.blit(test_text, test_text_pos)\n    pygame.display.flip()\n    aold = pygame.mouse.get_pressed()\n    if(any(aold) and (aold != anew)):\n        t2 = myrt_clock.tick(60)\n        rslts['time'] = t2 - t1\n        rslts['trial_num'] = rslts['trial_num'] + 1\n        actv_clr = which_buttons(aold)[0]\n        rslts['color'] = actv_clr\n        anew = aold\n        print(rslts)\n        \npygame.quit()\nsys.exit()\n\n\n8.2.1.3 Next Steps\nYou will want to save your data. As a first step see if you can open a file, and the if you can use the dictionary created to add lines to a csv file.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Before we can analyze data, we have to have some data. Broadly speaking our data may come from experiments we run ourselves, or it may come from data that is shared with us. In the first case we have some freedom to choose the format. In the later, we simply have to take what we are given. Therefore, we need to consider both how to save and convert data that we collect from an experiment. And we also need to be broadly familiar with common formats of data storage that others may use.\n\n10.0.0.1 Data Formats\n\nPlain Text\nCSV\nTSV\nJSON\nPickle\n\nDat (R)\n\nSome advantages and disadvantages of each.\nPlain text is easy to do and human readable. It usually will require a unique parser, and forces all items to be text. Thus, things like numbers lose their specificity, and things like lists can become painful to retrieve.\nCSV and TSV view all data as rows and a unique character (commas or tabs) separates the cells of the rows. Another character, typically a new line (often seen written as \\n) is what distinguishes one row from the next. These file types are, largely, human readable if the number of columns and rows are not too large. They are not as space efficient as other formats, but that may be a reasonable tradeoff when the size of the data files is small.\nJSON stands for Java Script Object Notation. Although, as the name implies, it had its origin in javascript it is largely language agnostic and is a common format for the storage of data of all types. Its being used as a standard means it has wide support from many programming languages and that means there are good tools for exporting and storing for most programming languages. It can be quite flexible in the type of data stored. It is not friendly for writing by hand, but the use of tools makes it fairly easy to take experimentally collected data created in, say, a python dictionary and convert it to a json format.\n\n\n\n\nimport random as r\nimport json as j\na = {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 24, 'rt': r.random()}\njs = j.dumps(a)\njs\n\n'{\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": 24, \"rt\": 0.9460735872292261}'\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: The dumps command will output the json version as a string.\n\n\n\nNote there is a very similar python function without the terminal s, json.dump, that will save the json data to a file. Some other code is needed to create the file pointer. But once that is done, and the json data saved, you can read it back with json.load()\n\n\n\n\nimport json\na = {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 24}\njs = json.dumps(a)\n\n# Open new json file if not exist it will create\nfp = open('test.json', 'a')\n\n# write to json file\nfp.write(js)\n\n# close the connection\nfp.close()\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: A simple example taken from [StackOverflow] shows a working example.\n\n\n\nA JSON tutorial can be found here.\nPickling is a data serialization library specific to the python ecosystem. That makes it useful if you are coding your experiment in python, but not in any other language. However, it can be very efficient on space, and there is good support for it in the python language so many experimental coding libraries built around python use pickle for data storage.\nThis code from a GeeksforGeeks article provides a nice minimal working example.\n\n\nimport pickle\n\ndef storeData():\n    # initializing data to be stored in db\n    Omkar = {'key' : 'Omkar', 'name' : 'Omkar Pathak',\n    'age' : 21, 'pay' : 40000}\n    Jagdish = {'key' : 'Jagdish', 'name' : 'Jagdish Pathak',\n    'age' : 50, 'pay' : 50000}\n\n    # database\n    db = {}\n    db['Omkar'] = Omkar\n    db['Jagdish'] = Jagdish\n    \n    # Its important to use binary mode\n    dbfile = open('examplePickle', 'ab')\n    \n    # source, destination\n    pickle.dump(db, dbfile)                    \n    dbfile.close()\n\ndef loadData():\n    # for reading also binary mode is important\n    dbfile = open('examplePickle', 'rb')    \n    db = pickle.load(dbfile)\n    for keys in db:\n        print(keys, '=&gt;', db[keys])\n    dbfile.close()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    storeData()\n    loadData()\n\nWhen working in the R environment the save and load function provide convenient ways to save your data and variables in their current state so that you can make available in your next interactive session what was available in your current one. However, this may not be the most interoperable way to work with your data if you need to share with collaborators who may not use R or if you yourself are open to the possibility of changing your analysis software. R offers two main functions for reading and writing data called read and write. Each of these has several specialization that target particular file types (e.g. read.csv) and also allow a number of customizations (e.g. whether to ignore a number of lines at the top of a file if there is a plain text header). Usually one of these variants will allow you to read your data into R or write data to a file that can be read by others.\n\n10.0.0.2 Considering Pandas and Interoperability with R\nPandas is a major python library and effort to provide cutting edge tools for statistics and analysis to match what is on offer elsewhere. In my experience they are not the first place that statisticians develop their cutting edge tools, R remains most popular, but for all else the choice between the two, R and Python, is really a matter of preference and comfort. Pandas is a very powerful tool and if you are more likely to use python in the future you will want to explore Pandas fully.\nPandas can usually be installed with pip install pandas. Because of the size and complexity of python installations a virtual environment is recommended.\nEven if you are not thinking of doing your data analysis in python if you are writing your experiments in python you might want to take advantage of some of the pandas tooling to make saving your data convenient. But before we show a pandas method let’s see a lower tech, more old school method.\nIt is possible to manually write a csv file in python using a print command where you explicitly coerce everything to a string and intercalate commas along the way. For example,\n\na = 1 \nb = \"britt\"\nc = 2.3\nmycolumnheadings = \"a,\" + \"b,\" + \"c\" + \"\\n\"\nmystring = str(a) + \",\" + b + \",\" + str(c) + \"\\n\"\nprint(mycolumnheadings + mystring)\n\na,b,c\n1,britt,2.3\n\n\nshows how to create a string from one’s data. It is complicated and error prone. It may work for a start or for a very small project, but it does not scale well. In this example I am just printing for display, but if this was being used to save experimental data we would want to use a file handler.\n\n10.0.0.2.1 Opening and Closing a File in Python\n\na = 1 \nb = \"britt\"\nc = 2.3\nmycolumnheadings = \"a,\" + \"b,\" + \"c\" + \"\\n\"\nmystring = str(a) + \",\" + b + \",\" + str(c) + \"\\n\"\nwith open('/home/britt/gitRepos/uwlooP390/p390/myfile.csv','w+') as f:\n    f.write(mycolumnheadings)\n    f.write(mystring)\n\nNow you can see if you can read that csv into R.\n\nmydata = as.data.frame(read.csv(\"/home/britt/gitRepos/uwlooP390/p390/myfile.csv\"))\nmydata\n\n  a     b   c\n1 1 britt 2.3\n\n\n\n\n10.0.0.2.2 A Better Way: Dictionaries\nPython dictionaries (which have their counterparts in most programming languages though they may be called something different) are a convenient way to store data where you can give it a meaningful name. For example, in an experiment with numerous trials and conditions you could have a key in your dictionary for “trial no.” and another for “condition”. The values for these would then be updated as your experiment unfolded.\nA first pass to using dictionaries is to blend this with a python library for CSV files. Then you can create the column headings from your keys and then each trial that you loop through you can use the dictionary to write a new row to your csv file. Some of the functions you might want to use are:\n\ncsv.DictWriter\nwriteheader\nwriterows\n\nIf you set up and define your dictionary at the start of the file you only need to update the changing values as they occur.\nAnother approach that will start you getting some familiarity with python pandas library is to make to make a distinct dictionary for each of the trials in your experiment. Then you can concatenate these dictionaries to a list and use that list to create a pandas dataframe. That could then be used in analysis python code or for importing into R. Here is a short example to illustrate the principle.\n\nimport random as r\nimport pandas as pd\n\nmylistofkeys=[\"name\",\"v1\",\"v2\",\"v3\",\"v4\"]\n\nmydictlist = []\nfor i in range(5):\n    mydictlist.append({key:value for key,value in zip([\"name\",\"v1\",\"v2\",\"v3\",\"v4\"],[\"britt\"] + [r.random() for i in range(5)])})\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(mydictlist)\n\ndf.loc[:,'v3'].mean()\n\nnp.float64(0.41749595529401706)\n\n\nmyfilename = \"mypandastest.csv\"\ndf.to_csv(myfilename)\n\nYou can save pandas dataframes as a pickle file, but then you will not be able to easily read it into R. CSV remains the easiest and most direct way to do this. It is probably all you need for most use cases. Though there are other options.\n\nrdf = read.csv(\"mypandastest.csv\")\nmean(rdf$v3)\n\n[1] 0.417496\n\n\n\n\n\n10.0.0.3 Some Analysis Tools\n\nPandas TBD\nSome more R TBD",

Some components of these videos may be a bit out of date, and a few things about the interface have changed. Still they may be a reasonable starting point for those of you who feel you need a refresher on version control. Note that for PSYCH390 I am assuming you can either already use version control or figure it out on your own. I will give some class time for getting things working, but mostly you will have to pursue this on your own. The notes here are intended to be prompts and guides, but not to be comprehensive.\nYou will notice that in the videos I talk a lot about Linux. We are not using that for this course so you can ignore those references. However, I do demonstrate the use in the terminal. That is available to all of you regardless of operating system. You will just have to find your own OS version of it.\nFrequenly you will see this referred to as a command line tool (“cli”). It is now easier to get this this working on Windows and OSX than it used to be. For OSX you can also check out Homebrew. For the adventurous Windows user you can look at WSL2.",

The first repository might be hosted on github, but the second one, the cloned one exists on a local machine. In your case this is probably your laptop.\nRemote: This is a repository that you are following. You will typically pull from these, but your push permissions may be limited depending on the distinctions between forks and clones, and whether you own the remote or someone else does. You can have more than one remote.\nPull: the transfer of information and changes from one repository incorporated into another. This is how you get the new information from a remote transported to a local repository that you control.\nPush: this is the transfer of information to a repository you control (or have permissions to push to) from another repository that you control. This is often from your local laptop version to the hosted repository (your fork) on github.\nPull Request: When you have information or changes that you think would be helpful to a remote you do not have push permissions for then you can request that the owner of that repository pull in your changes. This is a formal process called a pull request. It is primarily a github concept and not a git concept.\nBranch: within a repository the development of the code may be proceeding in a few different directions at the same time. The principal production branch is conventionally called master. And the principal repository that is the main, shared one is called origin. We will not be working with branches in our course, but those terms do show up in commands.\n\nAll of these “basics” are covered in detail in the book Pro Git (available on line).",

This can be using WSL or something like MinGW.\nOnce you have activated your venv you will see a change in the terminal display that indicates the venv is active. Now when you run things like pip install &lt;something&gt; it will install that library to a sandbox that is only accessible when using python from within that virtual environment. You should note that this notion of a sandbox or virtual environment is also available for some other programming languages.\nTo deactivate the environment you run ,\ndeactivate\nfrom within the venv. Look for the change in the terminal display. Note how activating the environment shows up in the terminal prompt.\nbritt@arts-220486 ~ % source p390venv/bin/activate\n(p390venv) britt@arts-220486 ~ % deactivate\nbritt@arts-220486 ~ % \n\n\nD.1.2 The Terminal is All You Need\nIf you are a minimalist or doing something simple you can invoke the python interpreter in your venv and complete your task there with no other tools, and using only the libraries required for your particular, limited task. However, if you use some companion tooling things may get more complicated and trickier to debug.",

    "text": "D.2 Visual Studio Code\nVS Code tries to make using a venv easier, but this also means there is some indirection that may make it harder to puzzle out errors. The basic work flow is to make sure that VS code is working in the folder you want your venv to be in. If not, use the open folder menu of VS Code to do so. Then, you can use the Command Palette (found under the View menu tab) to locate the Python Create Environment command. If you have never created an environment before it will do so. This can take some time so be patient and make sure this process completes. If there was a virtual environment previously constructed VS Code will probably be able to figure that out and ask you if you want to re-use it. Usually you will, but if not you can select to destroy it and create a new one. You will probably also need to affilate a particular python version to association to your environment. VS Code can often make a reasonable suggestion and you can also use the command Python Select Interpreter if necessary.\nAfter you have done that you will need to move into the affiliated terminal window of your VS Code environment to install the necessary libraries. You will need to be deliberate and make sure that you are in the correct terminal. VS Code may have several of these open for different purposes if you are working on a complicated project.\nNote that while it may be convenient to use the VS Code terminals you do not have to. If you have a terminal program on your computer accessible to you outside of VS Code you can use VS Code as the editor and then move to your other terminal for activating and implementing and compiling the python project.\n\nD.2.1 Quarto Complications\nWhen you embed a python code block in your .qmd document you will want to compile it. Quarto is assembling a document. It will need more than just the libraries necessary for compiling the python code. It also needs the library for the textual and graphical representation of the output that you will insert into your document. Specifically, it needs the jupyter python library. This means that whatever the python is doing, even if no additional libraries are needed, you will have to have done a pip install jupyter in your venv and you will need to have the venv active for the location where the qmd is stored and compiled.\nIt is worth knowing that although VS Code offers the convenience of buttons to invoke the quarto process it is not necessary. You can invoke all the quarto commands through a terminal directly. For instance quarto preview &lt;file-name&gt;.qmd will try to compile your file and will also usually launch your browser so you can see the html result. It will then watch the source file and update the html whenever it detects you have changed the source. This can be quite convenient for editing.",
