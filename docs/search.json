    "text": "Preface\nThis course is an effort to expose research minded undergraduate students in psychology to the wealth of computational and programming tools that they can use to ease their research tasks, and in some cases do things that they could not do otherwise. It is in written as a series of qmd files. This makes it a Quarto book. Quarto can be seen as a successor to RStudio and Rmd files. It is in another in the series of markup languages that allow you to write in plain text, but by following certain conventions, make it easy to convert those plain text files into any number of output formats such as html (for a website) or pdf (for a book or article). I want to emphasize the writing of reproducible code and papers. There are many different systems that can accomplish this goal. Quarto is just one option, but it is one of the easier ones to get started with. In addition, to Quarto, we will explore IDEs via Visual Studio Code, and also some of the basics of programming, bibliographic tools, and auxilliary tools like zettlekasten and databases.\nYou do not need to read this book in order. At this early draft stage some things are repeated, some are missing, and some are misordered. You may have to jump around to find what you are looking for.\nOne of the key lessons for learning to use your computer effectively as a research tool is learning how to do things generally; rather than mastering one particular variety of software; we want to be able to figure out how to use whatever is the right tool for a particular application. Your needs will change as your science evolves. The tools available will change. You don’t want to be still using the software you learned in University twenty years from now. If you are you will be less able to tackle the problems that interest you. Instead of doing the key experiment, you will be figuring out how to do the experiment that is most like, but not quite, the right one, but is as well as you can do with the old software you know how to use.",

Some answers to these questions will be discussed in a later chapter.\n\nHow do you protect yourself against a change in databases or death of a harddrive?\n\n\n2.1.2 Do the research\nWhat skills are needed for this?\n\nProgram an experiment\nLanguage?

Can you download and install the necessary software?\nWhat happens to the data?\n\nHow do you store it?\nHow do you search it?\nWhat if it is big?\nWhat if it needs to be shared?\n\nDatabases are something I hope to document further.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Analyzing the Research\n\nHow do you organize the data?\nWorking on a big data project?\n\nHow do you get the data?\nCan you set up a database?\nSearch it?\n\nHow do you do statistics?\n\nWhat is the tool?\nCould you write your own analysis?\n\nSome material on the R programming language, a frequently used programming language for statistical analysis, can be found in this chapter.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Diseminate the Research\n\nWhat is the tool you use for writing your research?\nWhat is reproducibility?\nDoes your writing tool support it?\nHow do you make sure others can re-run your analyses?\nHow do you make sure that you can easily adapt your analyses and make sure the right figures are included when you update the data? Or that the p-values in the text are also adapted?\nHow do you change the citation format when you submit to a journal that does not want APA or an edit changes which of your citations is the first (so it changes when you use et al)?\n\nI have a lot to say on writing tools in this chapter.\n\n\n2.1.5 Make Your Research Open\nA selfish reason for learning these tools is that it will make what you do easier and better.

The first repository might be hosted on github, but the second one, the cloned one exists on a local machine. In your case this is probably your laptop.\nRemote: This is a repository that you are following. You will typically pull from these, but your push permissions may be limited depending on the distinctions between forks and clones, and whether you own the remote or someone else does. You can have more than one remote.\nPull: the transfer of information and changes from one repository incorporated into another. This is how you get the new information from a remote transported to a local repository that you control.\nPush: this is the transfer of information to a repository you control (or have permissions to push to) from another repository that you control. This is often from your local laptop version to the hosted repository (your fork) on github.\nPull Request: When you have information or changes that you think would be helpful to a remote you do not have push permissions for then you can request that the owner of that repository pull in your changes. This is a formal process called a pull request. It is primarily a github concept and not a git concept.\nBranch: within a repository the development of the code may be proceeding in a few different directions at the same time. The principal production branch is conventionally called master. And the principal repository that is the main, shared one is called origin. We will not be working with branches in our course, but those terms do show up in commands.\n\nAll of these “basics” are covered in detail in the book Pro Git (available on line).",

This can be using WSL or something like MinGW.\nOnce you have activated your venv you will see a change in the terminal display that indicates the venv is active. Now when you run things like pip install &lt;something&gt; it will install that library to a sandbox that is only accessible when using python from within that virtual environment. You should note that this notion of a sandbox or virtual environment is also available for some other programming languages.\nTo deactivate the environment you run ,\ndeactivate\nfrom within the venv. Look for the change in the terminal display.

    "text": "D.2 Visual Studio Code\nVS Code tries to make using a venv easier, but this also means there is some indirection that may make it harder to puzzle out errors. The basic work flow is to make sure that VS code is working in the folder you want your venv to be in. If not, use the open folder menu of VS Code to do so. Then, you can use the Command Palette (found under the View menu tab) to locate the Python Create Environment command. If you have never created an environment before it will do so. This can take some time so be patient and make sure this process completes. If there was a virtual environment previously constructed VS Code will probably be able to figure that out and ask you if you want to re-use it. Usually you will, but if not you can select to destroy it and create a new one. You will probably also need to affilate a particular python version to association to your environment. VS Code can often make a reasonable suggestion and you can also use the command Python Select Interpreter if necessary.\nAfter you have done that you will need to move into the affiliated terminal window of your VS Code environment to install the necessary libraries. You will need to be deliberate and make sure that you are in the correct terminal. VS Code may have several of these open for different purposes if you are working on a complicated project.\nNote that while it may be convenient to use the VS Code terminals you do not have to. If you have a terminal program on your computer accessible to you outside of VS Code you can use VS Code as the editor and then move to your other terminal for activating and implementing and compiling the python project.\n\nD.2.1 Quarto Complications\nWhen you embed a python code block in your .qmd document you will want to compile it. Quarto is assembling a document. It will need more than just the libraries necessary for compiling the python code. It also needs the library for the textual and graphical representation of the output that you will insert into your document. Specifically, it needs the jupyter python library. This means that whatever the python is doing, even if no additional libraries are needed, you will have to have done a pip install jupyter in your venv and you will need to have the venv active for the location where the qmd is stored and compiled.\nIt is worth knowing that although VS Code offers the convenience of buttons to invoke the quarto process it is not necessary. You can invoke all the quarto commands through a terminal directly. For instance quarto preview &lt;file-name&gt;.qmd will try to compile your file and will also usually launch your browser so you can see the html result. It will then watch the source file and update the html whenever it detects you have changed the source. This can be quite convenient for editing.",

To whet your appetite I have included a short video I made for another course showing some use of the Terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Question\n\n\n\nWhat is a terminal?\n\n\nTo use your terminal you need to do somethings first:\n\nFind your terminal. Different operating systems refer to the terminal differently. In Windows the =CMD.exe= [fn:1] command is an approximation to a terminal as is the Power Shell. For OSX you navigate to you applications, find the folder “Utilities” and look in their for the terminal application. For Linux it will depend on which particular flavor you have installed.\nLearn some terminology While they do not mean exactly the same thing, you will often find the following terms being used relatively interchangeably.\n\nterminal\nshell\ncommand line What they have in common is the idea of a text based interface to communicating with the operating system. What this means is that instead of opening a gui (gui: G raphical U ser I nterface) to navigate your file tree you do this with a text based system of commands.\n\nTry out some sample commands\n\n\n\n\n\nls\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Typing this command in your terminal will list the files and directory. What would you have to do to see the hidden files? How would you get more information about this function and how to use it?\n\n\n\n\n6.0.1 An Historical Aside\nIn the early days of computing people wrote their programs on punch cards. Some see the inspiration as the Jacquard machine. There are still programmers alive who can tell you their horror stories of tripping and falling and scattering their punch cards everywhere. Want to know if your program worked? Take it to the main frame data center, drop it off, and come back the next day to get your print out. Terminals came along as an alternative to communicating with big central processors. There was a screen and keyboard. By typing you could send input to the computer that returned the output to your screen. The terminals we have today are not true terminals, but emulators. Though few people refer to them as such. We emulate this old way of communicating to the processor because it works and is efficient.\n\n\n6.0.2 Why use a terminal?\nYou can get more done. You can get it done more quickly. Once you learn to do one hard thing you never have to figure out how to do it again, because you can easily script it. That is why you want to learn to use the terminal\nTerminals are ubiquitous. They are low in their resource usage. They permit remote logins without the need for sending graphics back and forth. In fact, the remote computer need not have a system installed for displaying windows or even a physical screen attached (called headless).\nKnowing how to use a terminal will allow you to use =ssh= to connect to remote hosts. It will allow you to quickly and efficiently navigate your system, and it will make it easy for you to do things that used to take ages.\n\n\n6.0.3 A scripting example\nWant to convert and compress a large directory of videos as I did for this course. No need to open up each in an application and click a bunch of mouse clicks. Just write a =bash= script to invoke a command line program to do all the work for you. Go get a cup of coffee and come back when the job is done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: How would you pronounce XKCD?\n\n\n\n\n   for i in *.MP4; \n   do name=`echo \"$i\" | cut -d'.' -f1`; \n   echo \"$name\"; \n   ffmpeg -i \"$i\" -c:v libx264 -b:v 1.5M -c:a aac -b:a 128k \"${name}S.mp4\";\n   done\n\nAlmost all of this I copied off the Internet where it appeared as an answer to a question from someone else wanting to do essentially the same thing I did. It took me a while to tweak it to my particular use case, but when that was done my problem was solved, /forever./ Every new batch of videos I just put in their own directory and run this script from the command line. Note that this script uses a for loop, this is a very common programming construct.\n\n\nfor (i in seq(1,5)) { print(i)}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n\n\nThis code block demonstrates a simple for loop for the R programming language.\n\n\n\n6.0.4 Resources on Terminals\nThere are a great many resources on how to use the terminal effectively, but don’t go out and read them all. One of the skills to learn in learning to use the computer is to develop your own set of links and resources you can go to when need arises. Don’t try to learn everything at once. You will get overwhelmed and discouraged. Instead you learn what you need when the need arises. And if you need to know something more than once, then you spend the time to dive deeper. There are a great many things about using the terminal that I do not know, but I know the ones I use often, and I know where to find more when I need to know more. You should do the same. Here are a few online resources to get you started.\n\nThe command line\nA Short Series of Terminal Lessons from the UbuntuWiki\nSome Scripting Basics\nAnother Scripting Introduction\n\nMost of what you want to do at the command line, at least in the beginning, you can do with typing directly into the terminal. But at some point you will want to write a file, a script, that has all the commands typed into it. They you can run that script from the terminal. This blog post has some basic background for how to get started.\nNote the use of the term “BASH”. This stands for the Bourne Again Shell. Your terminal can use different shells (and if you are using a mac you are probably using the zsh shell). So while you can use the terms interchangeably most of the time, they don’t mean exactly the same thing.\n\n\n6.0.5 Terminal Games Again\nThese will only work on linux and OS X. If you are on windows you could enable the linux subsystem for linux or you could learn the powershell equivalents. But I suggest that you use the terminals that are built into VS Code for practice. You will usually see these at the bottom of your screen. If not, there is a menu you can use to open one.\n\nls -la /home/\n\n\nWhat does all this output mean?\nWhat changes when you leave out the -la?\nWhat does the hyphen do?\n\n\nCan you find the location of your desktop folder in your terminal?\nCan you change to that directory? cd\nFind out where you are? pwd\nCan you find out who the computer thinks you are, your user name? whoami\nFind out how much free space you have on your computer disk. df -h\nHow do you get help for most of these commands? Usually command –help or (-h)\nHow do you find the manual? man ls\nNavigating\n\nPaths: absolute and relative.\nWhat do those “dots” mean?\nWhat do those slashes mean?\nTab is your friend.\nTry the up arrow too.\n\nFile ownership\n\nMake a text file from the command line. touch /home/yourname/Documents/testText.txt\nWho owns it?\n\nMake a directory mkdir /home/britt/Documents/myFirstDir/ Spaces are the enemy. Never use them, but if you have to, escape () them.\n\n\n\n6.0.6 Using the Terminal to Setup a Python Venv and install Jupyterlab\nThe terminal can also be a very convenient and direct to install programs. You are not clicking buttons in a gui and hoping things work. You have to know exactly what program you want and where you want to put it. As an example we see how we might use the terminal to establish a python virutal environment and use that venv to implement a jupyterlab setup. You will find more on python virtual environments in the appendix.\nOur goal is to be able to test and develop the idea of a jupyter lab notebook. But we will need several pieces of code installed. Assuming we have python3 installed we can use the terminal to set up a secure enviroment for creating a virtual environment. Think of a sandbox that let’s you play without getting the things you installed for experimentation conflict with your system’s tools.\n\nOpen a terminal\nMake a directory (mkdir)\n“cd” into your new directory and create the virtual environment\n\npython3 -m venv .\n\nNext, “activate” the environment with\n\nsource ./bin/activate\n\nNow you can install the needed packages with pip.\n\npip install numpy matplotlib jupyterlab",
